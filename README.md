The Cold Storage Control and Monitoring Website, developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline cold storage management for buyers, sellers, and operators. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and Node.js with Express.js for the back end, the website integrates MongoDB with Mongoose for efficient database management. Key features include JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt.js for password encryption, and CORS for data protection, ensuring robust security. The platform offers role-specific dashboards, enabling real-time price comparisons, storage bookings, and AI-powered chatbot support for seamless user navigation, making it a user-friendly and efficient solution for cold storage management.

Future Work:
Future enhancements could include IoT-enabled sensors for real-time temperature and humidity monitoring, a notification system for environmental deviations, multi-language support, detailed analytics, payment gateway integration, and a responsive design for cross-device compatibility. These features would further improve functionality and user experience
